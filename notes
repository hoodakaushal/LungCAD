1. PyQt GUI for user. He uploads stuff, and asks results to be generated.
2. GUI uses Paramiko to upload the file, and invokes the script to generate results on the server.
3. On server side, the script:
    a. Reads the test file, invokes python program to generate it's features.
    b. Loads the precomputed feature data, matches it with the current one, and sorts them. (C++)
    c. Takes the top ten matches, and puts them in results folder.
    Basically, the script ties together a bunch of bash, Python and C++ code.
4. User selects how many results he wants, and asks them to be downloaded.
5. GUI uses Paramiko to download the results via sftp.
